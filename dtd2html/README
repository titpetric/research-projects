A modification of the dtd2html perl script by author Steve Pomeroy

Modifications include:

- css for empty tags (consider them being an error)
- better formatting for attributes (support different style of DTD ATTLIST)
- improved spacing in multi-line comments which are not preformatted
- coloring of @todo text same as empty (to note unfinished documentation / other)

All modifications and scripts are released under the original license.
