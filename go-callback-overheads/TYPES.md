# Type binding, hydration and discovery

The VM calls Go functions it was handed. Those functions have types, and
a program has to be able to name them: `var x int64` needs `int64`, and
`var r *http.Request` needs a type the host never mentioned except as a
return value. This is how those names get into the runtime and what
happens to them at compile and execution time.

Nothing here is registered twice. Binding a function is the only step a
caller normally takes; everything the signature implies follows from it.

## Three stages

**Binding** is the caller's act: `rt.Bind("http.NewRequest",
http.NewRequest)` puts one callable in the runtime under one name.

**Discovery** is what the runtime does with that signature. It walks the
type graph reachable from the function and records every type it finds,
so a later `var` statement can name any of them.

**Hydration** is what a program does with a discovered type: `var u
url.URL` produces the zero value of `url.URL` in a slot, without the
host ever having registered `url.URL` or written a constructor for it.

## Discovery

`Bind` calls `discover` on the function's `reflect.Type`, which records
the type and recurses into everything reachable from it:

| Kind | Reached |
|------|---------|
| func | every parameter and every result |
| pointer, slice, array, chan | the element type |
| map | the key and the element type |
| struct | every exported field's type |
| any | every method's signature |

Struct fields are in that list because a program can read a field.
`req.Header` has to make `http.Header` nameable, and `http.Header` is
reachable from `*http.Request` only through the field.

Recursion stops on a type already in the registry, which is also what
keeps a recursive type from looping. Depth is capped at five, which is
what it takes to get from a binding to a field of the struct behind its
result:

```
http.NewRequest            depth 1  the func
  *http.Request            depth 2  a result
    http.Request           depth 3  the pointee
      http.Header          depth 4  a field
        []string           depth 5  the map's element
```

Names are `reflect.Type.String()`: `int64`, `*http.Request`,
`http.Header`, `func(string) http.Handler`. Two packages with the same
base name collide, and the later `Bind` wins; `BindType` is the way out
of that.

`any` is the exception. It prints as `interface {}`, which is not a name
a program can write, so the registry also holds it under the spelling Go
source uses.

### What one binding is worth

Binding ten standard library constructors, counting only what each
contributes beyond the predeclared seed:

| Binding | Types | Notable |
|---|---:|---|
| `http.NewRequestWithContext` | 111 | `*http.Request` `*url.URL` `url.Values` `io.Reader` |
| `http.NewRequest` | 86 | `*http.Request` `*url.URL` `url.Values` `io.Reader` |
| `http.FileServer` | 32 | `http.Handler` `http.FileSystem` |
| `http.NewServeMux` | 31 | `*http.ServeMux` `http.Handler` |
| `pprof.Handler` | 25 | `http.Handler` |
| `url.Parse` | 25 | `*url.URL` `url.Values` |
| `http.StripPrefix` | 25 | `http.Handler` |
| `json.NewDecoder` | 13 | `io.Reader` |
| `json.NewEncoder` | 9 | `*json.Encoder` `io.Writer` |
| `url.ParseQuery` | 9 | `url.Values` |
| all together | 118 | |

`http.NewRequestWithContext` reaches more than `http.NewRequest` for one
reason: `context.Context` is a parameter, and its methods pull in
`time.Time` and everything `time.Time`'s methods return.

The totals overlap heavily. Ten bindings contribute 118 types between
them where one of them contributes 111, because they are mostly walking
the same graph from different entry points.

`net/http` has no `NewClient`. Its only exported constructors are
`NewRequest` and `NewRequestWithContext`, so the client side of the
package is reached through the types those name rather than through a
constructor of its own.

### An interface that only one binding names

`http.Handler` is not mentioned by any signature in `net/http`'s
constructors. It arrives because `pprof.Handler` returns one:

```go
rt.Bind("pprof.Handler", pprof.Handler)  // func(string) http.Handler
```

After that, `var h http.Handler` resolves. The same interface also comes
in through `http.FileServer` and `http.StripPrefix`, which return and
take one. This is the general shape of the thing: a type becomes
nameable because some function the host bound has an opinion about it,
not because anyone declared it.

### Watching it happen

`Runtime.SetLogger` attaches an `slog.Logger` that discovery reports
through at debug level. A runtime without one pays nothing, because the
field is checked rather than defaulted.

```go
rt := NewRuntime()
rt.SetLogger(slog.New(slog.NewTextHandler(os.Stdout, &slog.HandlerOptions{
	Level: slog.LevelDebug,
})))
rt.Bind("http.NewRequest", http.NewRequest)
```

```
level=DEBUG msg=bind name=http.NewRequest signature="func(string, string, io.Reader) (*http.Request, error)"
level=DEBUG msg="type discovered" name="func(string, string, io.Reader) (*http.Request, error)" kind=func via=http.NewRequest depth=1 methods=0
level=DEBUG msg="type discovered" name=io.Reader kind=interface via=http.NewRequest depth=2 methods=1
level=DEBUG msg="type discovered" name=*http.Request kind=ptr via=http.NewRequest depth=2 methods=0
```

`via` is the binding the walk started from and `depth` is how far it had
to go, so a name that turns up unexpectedly can be traced to the
signature that dragged it in.

`Runtime.Types` returns the registry as a list. `atkins test:discovery`
runs the test that prints all of this, including a table per binding and
the full set of names.

### Registering a type by hand

Only for a type no binding mentions:

```go
rt.BindType("io.Closer", (*io.Closer)(nil))
```

The value is a value of the type. An interface has no value to pass, so
a nil pointer to it works and `BindType` takes the element type. What is
registered is then walked like anything else.

## Hydration

A `var` statement resolves its type name against the registry and puts
that type's zero value in scope:

```
var x int64;
x = 123;

var b []uint8;
var r *http.Request;

var u url.URL;
json.NewEncoder(dest).Encode(u.Path);
```

The type name can carry `*` and `[]` prefixes, matching how
`reflect.Type.String()` spells them. An unknown name is a compile error
naming the fix: `unknown type "nope.Thing", register it with BindType`.

The zero value costs nothing to produce. On the direct-call tier the
frame is one allocation that comes back zeroed, so a declared name is
already its zero value with no instruction; on the reflect tier it is a
`reflect.Zero` recorded at compile time and written once per run.

### Inference

There is no short declaration for a literal, so `x = 123` has to work
out what `x` is. Three rules, in order:

1. A `var` statement fixes it.
2. Otherwise the first binding the program passes the name to decides,
   including through a nested call.
3. Otherwise the literal keeps the width the parser produced: `int64`,
   or `float64` when it has a decimal point.

```
var x int32;
x = 7;          int32, from the declaration

x = 5;
takesInt(x);    int, from the use

x = 5;          int64, nothing to infer from
x = 5.5;        float64
```

A declared type is not overridden by use. `var x int64; x = 5;
takesInt(x);` reports `cannot use int64 as int` rather than quietly
converting, because the declaration is the statement of intent.

### Literals at the call

A numeric literal takes the type of the parameter it fills. The parser
produces only `int64` and `float64`, so without this a binding taking
`int` could not be given a literal at all. The value has to be
representable, and a literal that is not is a compile error rather than
a wrap:

```
takesInt(42)      int(42)
takesU32(7)       uint32(7)
takesF32(7)       float32(7)
takesI8(300)      300 overflows int8
takesU32(-1)      cannot use -1 as uint32, it is negative
takesInt(1.5)     cannot use 1.5 as int, it has a decimal point
```

An empty interface parameter keeps the width the parser produced, since
there is no parameter type to convert towards.

## What this costs at execution

Discovery and hydration are compile-time. Nothing in this document runs
per call: the registry is consulted when a `var` statement compiles, the
literal is converted when the argument compiles, and the zero value is
either the zeroed frame or a `reflect.Value` recorded once.

Scalars reach the direct-call tier. Each width is its own layout class,
because the cast that makes a direct call needs the exact Go type: an
`int32` parameter is four bytes where an `int64` is eight, and a float
travels in a different register file from an integer of the same width.
`int` and `uint` follow their size rather than their kind, so they share
a class with `int64` and `uint64` on a 64 bit platform.

Between them, these all run without `reflect.Value.Call`:

```
var x int64;
x = 1;
json.NewEncoder(dest).Encode(x);

var x float64;
x = 2.5;
json.NewEncoder(dest).Encode(x);

var b bool;
json.NewEncoder(dest).Encode(b);

x = 1;
json.NewEncoder(dest).Encode(x);

var x int64;
x = 3;
takesI64(x);

json.NewEncoder(dest).Encode(takesInt(42));

req := http.NewRequest("GET", "/");
json.NewEncoder(dest).Encode(req.ContentLength);
```

Boxing a scalar into an interface allocates, because the data word has
to point at a value of the concrete width. That is the allocation the Go
compiler makes at the same place.

The shape table is finite and a program JITs whole or not at all, so a
call whose parameter and result classes are not in it sends the whole
program to the reflect evaluator. `Runtime.Supports` reports which call
and which shape, so this is visible rather than something to discover in
a benchmark.
