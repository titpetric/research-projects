MonoSVN

The goal of the MonoSVN project is to send out colorized HTML emails
with the differences for each commit to Subversion repositories.

Configuration is flexible to allow reporting on huge repositories
which provide different levels of access to specific sections of
the repository for authorized users.

It's main features are:

   - E-mail colorized diff files depending on the location
     in the repository, where the commit was made or depending
     on the user who made the commit. Emails also link to websvn,
     to review changes via the websvn application.

   - Lint checking for syntax errors in commited PHP scripts
     and XML files (configurable in the config, can add new
     lint checks into include/class.lint.php, can skip lint
     checking with ".nosyntax" - usefull sometimes)

   - Configurable "blacklist" of files, which can't be added
     to any location in SVN (for example, temporary files with
     a standard extension - *.tmp, *.bak, *~, ...)

   - Disallow commits with no commit message

The MonoSVN project uses the MiniTPL project to provide a stylable
email template, which can be modified based on your preferences.

Setup
-----

Make sure to set the ownership of the files to the user, which
runs your dav_svn instance (apache, usually "www-data:www-data").
If that doesn't work for you, make the templates/cache/ directory
writable, so the template has a writable compile location.

Copy the file "conf/monosvn.xml-dist" to "conf/monosvn.xml", and
modify it based on your websvn location and configure the email
destinations based on rules you want. Most settings should work
for most people out of the box.

To use, you need to add the following lines to your subversion
repository hooks/pre-commit and hooks/post-commit scripts.

hooks/post-commit:

    REPOS="$1"
    REV="$2"

    /[path-to]/php /[path-to]/monosvn.php post-commit "$REPOS" "$REV"

hooks/pre-commit:

    REPOS="$1"
    TXN="$2"

    /[path-to]/php /[path-to]/monosvn.php pre-commit "$REPOS" "$TXN" || exit 1
    exit 0

That should be it :)
